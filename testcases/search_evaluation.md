# Search Evaluation

## Overview

The AI-DAM semantic search was evaluated using 10 natural-language queries across
images, videos, and PDFs. Each query was selected to test a different type of
visual or document-oriented search intent.

The evaluation records the expected asset type/content, observed results,
relevance, and limitations. Results are ranked by semantic similarity score.

## Additional Relevance Checks

Live spot checks during a fresh index found that the actual image content can
disagree with filenames:

| Query | Expected content | Observed result |
| ----- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| `tall modern building with a grid of windows` | A modern skyscraper | `modern_kitchen.jpg` was correctly identified as a tall building (score 0.84). Canal and castle false positives scored 0.37 and 0.34 and are below the 0.50 cutoff. |
| `woman standing in a forest` | A woman in a forest | `cat_portrait.jpg` matched the visible forest scene (score 0.64), despite its misleading filename. A partial woman-only match scored 0.48 and is below the cutoff. |
| `cat` | Images that visibly contain cats | Three captioned cat images scored 0.58–0.63; the unrelated `cat_portrait.jpg` was not returned. |
| `woman standing in a forest` (keyword fallback) | A forest scene, not any image mentioning “woman” | A candidate matching only one of three query terms scored 0.33 and is rejected by the fallback relevance test. |

## Overall Findings

### What worked

- Natural-language semantic queries successfully retrieved visually related
  images and videos.
- Queries did not need to exactly match filenames.
- The system retrieved related concepts, such as `yellow flower` returning
  sunflower assets.
- Cross-media retrieval worked: image, video, and PDF assets could appear in
  the same search results.
- Text-oriented queries such as `document with text` successfully retrieved
  text-based PDFs.

### Observed limitations

- Some short or generic PDFs received relatively high semantic similarity
  scores for visual queries.
- Broad queries such as `nature` and `outdoor scene` naturally produced a
  wider range of related assets.
- Semantic similarity does not guarantee literal keyword relevance.
- The evaluation demonstrates that ranking is based on embedding similarity
  rather than exact keyword matching.

### Special handling during evaluation

Four noisy/non-useful PDFs were marked as `excluded` rather than deleted:

- `inline-image.pdf`
- `habibi.pdf`
- `habibi-oneline-cmap.pdf`
- `habibi-rotated.pdf`

These files remain in the local dataset but are excluded from normal search
results.
